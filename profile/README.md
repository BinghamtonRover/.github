### About Us
We are currently working on designing, building, and prototyping a Mars rover to compete in The Mars Society's [University Rover Challenge (URC)](https://urc.marssociety.org/). Watch our [2022 System Acceptance Review submission on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp6v6LOuFq0).

Our team is organized into seven subteams:
* Environmental Analysis
* Electrical
* Drive
* Drone
* Human-Robot-Environment Interaction
* Project and Operations Management
* Software

We all work together to design, build, and integrate various portions of the rover. Our GitHub profile primarily supports our software team. Most of our software projects are open-source and can be found on this profile.

Our code is split into different repositories based on functionality:

- [Dashboard](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Dashboard)
- Networking: [Protobuf](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Protobuf), [Python UDP](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Networking), [Firmware Utilities](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Firmware-Utilities), [MARS Server](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/MARS-Server)
- Onboard code: [Subsystems](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Subsystems), [Autonomy](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Autonomy), [Video](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Video)
- Firmware: [TMC](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/TMC-Firmware), [Arm](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Arm-firmware), [Electrical](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Electrical-firmware), [Science](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Science-firmware), [Drive](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Drive-Firmware), [MARS](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/MARS-Fimware)


When cloning multiple repositories to your computer, it is recommended to keep the above structure for organization.
