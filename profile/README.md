### About Us
We are currently working on designing, building, and prototyping a Mars rover to compete in The Mars Society's [University Rover Challenge (URC)](https://urc.marssociety.org/). Watch our [2022 System Acceptance Review submission on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp6v6LOuFq0).

Our team is organized into seven subteams:
* Environmental Analysis
* Electrical
* Drive
* Drone
* Human-Robot-Environment Interaction
* Project and Operations Management
* Software

We all work together to design, build, and integrate various portions of the rover. Our GitHub profile primarily supports our software team. Most of our software projects are open-source and can be found on this profile.
