### About Us
We are currently working on designing, building, and prototyping a Mars rover to compete in The Mars Society's [University Rover Challenge (URC)](https://urc.marssociety.org/). Watch our [2022 System Acceptance Review submission on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp6v6LOuFq0).

Our team is organized into seven subteams:
* Environmental Analysis
* Electrical
* Drive
* Drone
* Human-Robot-Environment Interaction
* Project and Operations Management
* Software

We all work together to design, build, and integrate various portions of the rover. Our GitHub profile primarily supports our software team. Most of our software projects are open-source and can be found on this profile.

Our code is split into different repositories based on functionality:

- Firmware: [Arm](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/arm-firmware), [Electrical](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/control-firmware), [Science](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/science-firmware)
- Onboard code: [Autonomy](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Autonomy), [Subsystems](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Subsystems-Computer), [Video](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/Video)
- Networking: [CAN](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/burt-can), [Protobuf](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/rover-api), [Transport](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/network), 
- [Dashboard](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover/rover-control-dashboard)

When cloning multiple repositories to your computer, it is recommended to keep the above structure for organization.
